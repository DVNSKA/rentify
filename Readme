Rentify
Rentify is a web application designed to streamline the process of renting properties. It consists of two main components: the API and the client.

API
The API folder contains all the backend code for Rentify. It is built using Express.js, a minimalist web framework for Node.js, to handle server-side operations. MongoDB is used as the database to store and manage data related to properties, users, and rental transactions.
